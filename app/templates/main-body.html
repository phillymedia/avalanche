                    them hard like wet cement flying down a funnel at 30 miles per hour, gouging faces and breaking legs and wrists and skulls, burying them alive.</span>

                <p>Once the avalanche had crashed onward, Tony staggered down the incline, looking for his teenage friends. Soon, he heard a small voice from under the snow. He began frantically digging, but could only dislodge another boy down to his hips.

                    <div class="containerPhotoCaption" alignment="true">On July 13, 1955 in Banff, Alberta, two survivors Tony Woodfield, 16, (seated at left) and Peter Smith, 14, (seated at right center) tell others who stayed at camp their story of surviving the July 11th avalanche on Mt. Temple that
                        killed seven boys. </div>
                </div>
                <p>With Tony at his side, the boy froze to death – one of seven to die needlessly in a misguided mountaineering expedition in 1955 whose deadly end spread sorrow through one of Philadelphia's most affluent communities, captured headlines
                    worldwide and remains an appalling example of the abdication of adult leadership.</p>
                <p>At age 71, Anthony Woodfield revisted the disaster in a series of extraordinary emails.</p>
                <p>In those messages, recently made available to The Inquirer, he is both an elderly man months away from dying of cancer and a desperate teen of 16 back on Mount Temple in the Canadian Rockies. There, 10,000-feet up, in the dark and sleet
                    on July 11, 1955, he literally took the shirt off his back to try to save his young friends. </p>

                <p>As the disaster slips from living memory into history, The Inquirer is taking a look back at the tragedy. In postcards sent by campers on a trip to their doom, in hundreds of pages of inquest transcripts, in faded accounts from long-shuttered
                    newspapers, in yearbook memorials, in interviews with the last living survivor of the disaster, a vivid story emerges of unforgivable errors, of a night of horror, hail and death on a windswept mountain – and of heroism by boys as
                    young as 12. </p>

                <p>This account also makes public Tony Woodfield's emails – and the poignant replies from Laura Watts Pearson, the sister of the boy he could not save . </p>
                <p>In her response, Watts Pearson responded as strongly to Tony Woodfield's plight as he faced terminal illness as she did to his new information about the death of her brother. If Tony Woodfield for looking for closure and comfort at the
                    end of his life, Laura rose to that challenge magnificently.</p>

                <p>In her 1950s diary, the mother of one of the slain boys wrote that she refused to look at her son's broken body in death. "I wanted to remember him driving out of Chestnut Hill Academy, looking back at me and waving his hand," she wrote.</p>

For Craig McCoy&#039;s story of the 1955 Mount Temple tragedy in the Canadian Rockies that
                        killed seven young boys.</div>
                </div>
                <p>The boys climbing into the two vehicles ranged in age from 12 to 16. The two oldest, who will loom large in this narrative, were <span name-data="tony" class="highlight">Tony Woodfield</span> and <span name-data="billy" class="highlight">Billy Watts Jr.</span>, 10th graders enrolled
                    in separate New England boarding schools. They were both natural athletes and leaders. Tony, thin and tall, with chiseled features, had grown up in Switzerland and already had had a fair amount of experience with climbing in the Alps.
                </p>

                <p>The blonde Billy wasn't bookish like Tony, but had plenty of common sense. And like his father and namesake, Billy had charm to burn. He'd transferred to his school in Connecticut from Chestnut Hill Academy the previous fall.</p>
                <p>They were proud to be named the trip's two teenage "crew chiefs."</p>
                <p>In all, 22 boys had signed up for an ambitious summer trip put together by Kershaw, the teacher at Chestnut Hill Academy who had founded Wilderness Travel Camp eight years before. The grandson of a venerated headmaster at Germantown Academy,
                    Kershaw had the pedigree and contacts to attract the kind of boys whose families were in the Social Register, prep school students bound for Harvard, Yale or Kershaw's alma mater, Stanford.</p>
                <p>For $2,500 in today's dollars and a signed release from liability, parents bought a 6 ½-week expedition that took their sons across the United States and into western Canada. The traveling camp would include visits to national parks in
                    both countries, camping, canoeing and climbing. </p>
                <p>Kershaw, then 31, and business partner Don Dickerson, 29, planned the trip, They decided a highlight would be climbing 11,626-foot Mount Temple, a popular tourist destination that was one of the tallest peaks in gorgeous Banff National
                    Park in Canada, west of Calgary.</p>
                <p>Kershaw was not along for the trip itself. Instead, he took a different group of boys that June on a trip through New England. Though few knew it at the time, Kershaw was a deeply troubled and dangerous man. As The Inquirer reported in
                    April, Kershaw's former students at Chestnut Hill Academy say he used these kinds of trips as a means to molest them. He pleaded guilty in 1977 to sexually abusing two 11-year-old boys enrolled in his camp that summer.</p>

Dickerson, who lived in Philadelphia's
                    Mount Airy section, was an insurance whiz who lectured at the Wharton School. Oeser had graduated from Penn State after growing up in Philadelphia. He taught at a Baltimore junior high.</p>

                <p>The drive west was full of incident. The hearse broke down in North Dakota, and the boys camped out in a town park in Minot for five days while it was repaired. On the road again, the two-car caravan headed to Yellowstone and Glacier National
                    Parks. While the boys took in the view at Glacier, porcupines chewed flat all four of the hearse's tires. They liked the salt on them.</p>
                <p>In a postcard to his parents that arrived just after his death, one of the boys wrote of Glacier's beauty – and of their "big snowball battle" on the Fourth of July.</p>
                <p>Two weeks after leaving Philadelphia, Dickerson, Oeser and their charges entered the Banff park, 4,500-feet up, a spectacular range of peaks and glaciers, of alpine meadows and lakes, of bears and caribou. On Thursday, July 7, they pitched
                    their tents at Two Jack Lake there.</p>
                <p>Billy Watts, in a letter to his 8-year-old sister, Laura, wrote proudly of how he was a crew chief, cooking for the rest on an Army stove.</p>

                <p>The goal was to climb Mount Temple and then head to another national park in Canada for more adventure. They were to return to Philadelphia in early August. </p>
                <p>In the village of Banff, Dickerson headed to the park information offices and picked up mountain maps. But, he later complained, he couldn't find anyone expert about Mount Temple, just "some girls" in the office who "seemed to know absolutely
                    nothing about the mountains in the area." For its part, the office staff found him impatient and incurious. </p>
                <p>Nor did Dickerson fill out a form registering his plan climb the mountain. He said he ignored the form because it asked what day his group would be climbing and he hadn't decided yet.</p>

            <p>Despite the lack of information, Dickerson and Oeser stuck with the plan. On Saturday, June 9, they scaled part way up 9,675-foot Mount Rundle, just outside Banff, returning to their campsite late, at almost 10 p.m. This climb went well.
                </p>
                <p>The next day, they moved their camp near the foot of Mount Temple, setting up at Lake Moraine, glacier-fed and startlingly blue. On Monday, they would tackle the snow-capped mountain, only 250 feet shorter than the highest peak in the
                    park. </p>
                <p>While the popular trek up Mount Temple's southern side is known as a "scramble" – climbers don't need spikes or other equipment used in technical climbing - it is not a mountain to approach lightly. In places, hikers must haul themselves
                    from handhold to handhold to ascend vertical bands of rock. Some climbers hire guides for the trip and some of those guides rope up clients for tougher traverses.</p>
                <p>There is danger from falling rock, cliffs – and avalanches.</p>
                <p>Experienced climbers stay off the mountain in early summer when rising temperatures melt snow, creating the conditions for avalanches. In 1955, an early spring had heated up the mountain, melting the snow, and "it was known to be dangerous,"
                    wardens said. For that reason, if Dickerson had found park officials to ask about Mount Temple, one said later, "We would have advised them against going anywhere near it." </p>
                <p>Nonetheless, the boys pushed off that Monday morning. Though they likely didn't know it, they were first ones to tackle the mountain that year. Dickerson stayed behind. A heavy smoker, he was too winded to climb. Six boys also took a pass.
                    That left Oeser, with far less climbing experience, in charge. Neither he nor Dickerson knew that avalanches were a risk on Mount Temple.</p>
                <p>The 16 climbers were not well equipped. Many lacked hiking boots. Instead they wore baseball shoes with cleats or even track shoes. They carried only 150 feet of manila rope, in just two lengths. Many of the boys wore only thin summer
                    shirts. The entire group had one ice axe.</p>
                <p>Oeser and the boys hiked for four or five hours, working their way higher via switchbacks to the pass that connected Paradise Valley with the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This put them up on Sentinel Pass, which cuts between 10,062-foot Pinnacle
                    Mountain and the higher Mount Temple. At the pass, the group took a right to scale the southern face of Mount Temple. </p>
                <p>At about 8,500 feet, just above the snow line, Oeser and his 16 boys reached a meadow. Oeser called a halt. He had a nasty blister on his foot. Besides, he would say later, "Unfortunately, heights do not agree with me entirely." He told
                    the boys that he, too, was dropping out.</p>
                <p>He wanted them to quit, too. The boys wanted to keep going. After all, it was a balmy 76 degrees. The summit seemed close. Oeser relented. He took a seat, pulled off his shoes, and waved the boys onward. "Be careful," he said.</p>
                <p>Tony Woodfield and Billy Watts were now in charge. In short order, five more tired youngsters abandoned the climb, clambering down Mount Temple to rejoin Oeser.</p>
                <p>That left 11 still ascending. </p>
                <p>The youngest were two 12-year-olds, Miles Marble and Peter Smith. Marble was an only child who was a blur on the basketball court at Germantown Friends School. His favorite expression: "Oh rot." The tousle-haired Smith, a Haverford School
                    student from Paoli, was outgoing, but intense.</p>
                <p>There were the 13-year-old Balis twins: Ricky and Townsend, aka "Towny," eighth-graders at Chestnut Hill Academy. Their parents must have seen them off with some trepidation. Before the twins were born, the family's first child was killed
                    at age 5 in front of his Chestnut Hill home when he rode his scooter into traffic.</p>
                <p>There was Frederic Ballard, 13, also a "Ricky," another Chestnut Hill Academy eight-grader. His great-grandfather has founded Philadelphia's Ballard Spahr law firm and his grandfather and father were lawyers there. His mother was Ernesta
                    Ballard, a civic leader and feminist years before the term had any wide popularity.</p>
                <p>Luther Seddon, 13, of St. Louis, one of few boys from a public school, had joined to vacation with a friend from Chestnut Hill. The caravan had picked him up in Chicago. On Mount Temple, his friend was among those who dropped out. Seddon
                    kept going.</p>
                <p>The bespectacled Terry Clattenburg, 14, a former student of Kershaw's at Chestnut Hill Academy, was the son of an architect. He bunked in a tent with the twins and camper David Chapin.</p>
                <p>Along with the twins, Clattenburg, 14, and Chapin, 15, also elected to keep climbing. Chapin as a friend of Woodfield's at Berkshire boarding school in western Massachusetts. His father was an ad executive in a new field, television. At
                    Berkshire, he loved to hike nearby Mount Everett, albeit a mountain one-quarter the size of Mount Temple. A photograph from his teens shows him with a big grin, a big cowboy hat and a backpack.</p>
                <p>Willie Wise, 15, the son of a Souderton doctor, was a coltish 15-year-old in the middle of a growth spurt. It was his second consecutive summer with Wilderness Travel. This time, he was hoping the hiking would toughen him up for football
                    at Penn Charter School. A junior there, he was a gentle soul, a Lutheran acolyte who lit the candles during services. He'd read just about everything by Bruce Catton on the Civil War. </p>
                <p>At first, the boys seemed to bound upward, encouraged by the warmth. What they didn't realize was that heat was a growing threat.</p>
                <p>In fact, Oeser and the boys had started out that morning far too late. They had set off from Lake Moraine at about 9:30 a.m., hours after most climbers depart to summit Mount Temple. That meant the boys were still out there when the afternoon
                    sun was turning from friend to foe. As time passed, the heat began to sap their energy, slowing them and keeping them on the mountain longer and later. Hour by hour, the sun was thawing the snow, making it unstable. In fact, the afternoon
                    was unseasonably hot, the climax of a run-up that had seen temperatures climb nearly 20 degrees in just five days.</p>
                <p>They should have been off the mountain by noon. They weren't.</p>
                <p>Now well above the snow line, the boys found the going increasingly rough. The path was narrower. The snow was deeper and slushier. Some of the boys slipped here and there. Frostbite was creeping though the thin leather of the boys' shoes.
                    As they scrambled upwards, the boys saw how a kicked rock would trigger a slide of snow. The boys saw and heard avalanches on neighboring peaks. This was no longer fun. Towny Balis was simply too light to stamp footholds in the snow,
                    and he was visibly afraid.</p>
                <p>Tony and Billy called a halt. They agreed. Forget the summit. It was time to get down.</p>
                <p> After a 15-minute break at 10,000 feet, the boys began their descent. Mostly to calm anxiety, the group roped up. The 11 boys tied themselves together at five-feet intervals, tightening their thin manila rope – "not much more than a laundry
                    line," Tony said – with slipknots. Tony Woodfield was the anchor, highest on the mountain, with the others stretched out below him. Billy Watts was the lead man on the other end.</p>
                <p> The 16-year-olds were piling mistake upon mistake. Mountaineering experts say it's a bad idea to put too many climbers on any one rope or to tie them so close. Slipknots were also a poor choice. They can tighten and choke.</p>
                <p> Worse, the group was descending in a gully, rather than following the ridge line down – the recommended route not susceptible to avalanches. Most dangerous, a massive amount of increasingly unstable snow lay above them. "You have the whole
                    mountain sitting on top of you, particularly that time of day," said Bertram Pettaway, an assistant Banff park warden.</p>
                <p>Step by cautious step, the boys made it halfway to the meadow. Then, snow stirred 700 feet above them, a likely product of the sun and not of the boys' movement or noise. The avalanche burst forth at 4 p.m., a violent and accelerating
                    tonnage of snow, ice and rock, rolling down the gully, gaining force at it swept into a funnel formed by rock. The noise began as a hiss, but soon was loud as an oncoming train.</p>
                <p>"Avalanche!" Tony yelled. "Head for cover!."</p>

                <p><span class="firstp">When the avalanche engulfed them all, Tony [1] was the only boy with an axe. He plunged it into ice just beyond the gully and jumped sideways. Tony held on. Within the maelstrom of din and snow, he felt the rope tug and tighten at his
                    waist – and then relax.</span></p>
            </div>

                <p> Somehow Tony had been cut free from the Balis twins, the next boys on the rope. While Tony held fast. his fellow campers were driven hundreds of feet down the mountain. Some fell free, cut loose like Tony. Others tumbled like linked rag
                    dolls Some would end up buried, others visibly stunned and hurt on the surface.</p>
                <p>As the snow settled and the noise ebbed, Tony struggled to orient himself. He shook off snow blindness. Incredibly, he was unhurt. He had pretty much dodged the avalanche.. He had to find his friends, 1,000 vertical feet below. </p>
                <p>Some he would never find. Some were fatally injured immediately. Other would die of shock and exposure during the long wait for rescue. As night fell, as temperature plummeted, Mount Temple became a killing ground, a dark battlefield of
                    sorts strewn with bodies, swept by hail and snow, hours from help. </p>
                <p>Tony first spotted <span name-data="ricky" class="highlight">Ricky Ballard</span>, [2] three years his junior, Ricky was seated on rock, in shock, with a six-inch gash across his forehead. Tony stripped off his shirt and gave it to him.
                </p>
                <p>He next found <span name-data="terry" class="highlight">Terry Clattenburg</span>, [3] two years younger, badly injured with three skull fractures, his face raw and bleeding. Like Ballard, he had no recollection of being hit. He seemed
                    unable to move.</p>
                <p>He also found quickly found <span name-data="willie" class="highlight">Willie Wise</span>, [4] a year younger. Willie's face was lacerated. He was crying for help. Tony pulled another shirt from his rucksack and awkwardly wrapped him in
                    it. Among many other injuries, Willie's left wrist was broken. He, too, could barely move Tony tried to pull him off the wet snow and onto drier rocks, but couldn't make any headway.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, Tony heard a new voice. It was faint, but close, from under the snow. Using rocks and his hands, even his shoes, Toney began digging frantically at the spot where he had heard the sound. And as he cleared away the snow,
                    <span name-data="billy" class="highlight">Billy Watts
                        </span>, [5] his follow crew chief, emerged.</p>
                <p>Stabbing and scooping, Tony dug down to Billy's hips, but could get no further. Billy's left leg was trapped by rock-hard snow. So was his right arm. </p>
                <p>Light was fading. The temperature was falling rapidly. It had begun to hail.</p>
                <p>"I'm cold," Billy said.</p>
                <p>Tony reached into the pit he had dug, circled Billy's chest and pulled. Billy would not budge. Tony had no clue about the macabre reason Billy was anchored there.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, Tony heard another subterranean sound. It was a another voice from under the snow.</p>
                <p>Shirtless, freezing, Tony had to decide what to do. He made his choice. He stayed with Billy. If he divided his energy, he thought, two boys might die.</p>
                <p>Billy said he was very cold.</p>
                <p>"Move your limbs," Tony told him. "Hang onto life."</p>
                <p>Billy couldn't. He froze to death on Mount Temple, 2,500 miles away from his home in the Philadelphia suburbs.</p>

                <p><span class="firstp">When Woodfield screamed out his avalanche warning, Peter Smith [6] ducked and jammed his fingers into a rocky crevice. No matter. "The avalanche took me down with the rest," he said later. </span></p>

                <p>As a 12-year-old, <span name-data="peter" class="highlight">Peter</span> was at the youngest age permitted on the trip. When the avalanche struck, he was second from the front on the rope line, right behind Watts. As he was driven downward,
                    the rope slipped up around his neck, choking him. Riding the avalanche's front edge, Peter somehow freed himself of it.</p>
                <p>He stood, only to be hit by more snow and driven another 100 feet down Mount Temple. When he got upright again, Peter found that he was standing amid a scattered group of bodies. </p>
                <p>Though bruised and bleeding, Peter was mobile and mentally acute. Like Tony, he moved from boy to boy. He, too, found that there was little he could do. He decided to head down the mountain alone and get help. When the path permitted,
                    he ran.</p>
                <p>On his way down, Peter encountered a man coming up - Bill Oeser, the teacher from Baltimore with the blister on his foot and the fear of heights. Oeser had started climbing from the meadow after he thought he heard an indistinct cry for
                    help from high above. </p>
                <p>Oeser told Smith to keep heading down. When he arrived at the avalanche site, Oeser first spotted Luther Seddon [7] and Terry Clattenburg, still tied together. Seddon, his left leg twisted and broken, was sobbing for help. Clattenburg
                    remained deep in shock, unresponsive. Oeser cut the rope that connected them. </p>
                <p>He also cut rope tying the twins, Rick [8] and Towny Balis. [9] The brothers' thin shirts were soaked through. They had no coats. By Oeser's reckoning, one of the 13-year-old brothers was already dead, face-down in the snow.</p>
                <p>The teacher also came across Tony Woodfield. Tony was still with Billy. He was naked to the waist, chilled to the bone – and nearly incoherent. Oeser told him, too, to descend. </p>
                <p>Between them, Tony Woodfield and Bill Oeser had come across nine of the 11 boys struck by the avalanche. But where were Dave Chapin and Miles Marble? [10] [11]</p>

                <p>Smith was the first one to reach bottom. Dickerson, who had just returned to the campsite from buying groceries when Smith arrived, immediately headed up towards the accident site. On his way up, he passed Tony Woodfield on the way down.</p>
                <p>"Three or four of the boys seemed to be dead or dying and that he couldn't find Dave Chapin at all and he been three hours trying to dig Bill Watts out of the snow and they still had one leg pinned that they couldn't get out," Dickerson
                    recalled Tony saying.</p>
                <p>Ballard and Woodfield arrived at the bottom after Smith. Ballard too, had been met on his way down. At that point, rescuer Wes Gilsdorf, an assistant warden, had lifted him up bodily and carried him down.. </p>
                <p> As word spread at the mountain's base, an impromptu band of rescuers, made up park staff and volunteers, began to stream up Mount Temple. Despite his bruised hips and his facial cuts, Peter Smith had insisted that he guide the rescue party.
                    The rescuers set out at a furious pace to cover the five miles to the avalanche site, hiking and climbing in darkness. Their flashlights blazed their snake-like path through the woods. </p>
                <p>Among the rescuers was a house doctor from the massive Chateau Lake Louise luxury hotel near Banff and a couple of the hotel's bellhops. In charge was Swiss-born Walter Perren, the park service's new guru on mountain rescue. Perren, in
                    his early 40s, had been hired only weeks before to teach wardens rescue technique – a step spurred by the deaths of four climbers who had plummeted 1,500 feet the year before on a nearby Banff peak.</p>
                <p>Canadian Pacific Railway had first hired Perren in Switzerland a few years before to serve as a mountain guide for guests in its hotel chain. He hadn't lost his Swiss accent and was known for ending every talk with a warning, "Shtay oot
                    of the goolies" – stay out of the gullies that serve as funnels for avalanches and rock slides..</p>
                <p>The first rescuers arrived at the avalanche site at about 11 p.m. - seven hours after the avalanche had hit. </p>
                <p>Perren was astounded that Mount Temple was now the scene of so much death. For him, the mountain was "a little dull." After all, this was a man who had climbed the Matterhorn 135 times. Still, he realized well that a mountain that was
                    perfectly safe in the early-morning chill could pose a threat later in the day. </p>
                <p>Having climbed Mount Temple many many times, Perren knew this beyond doubt: "It is a dangerous mountain for people who don't know anything about climbing." </p>
                <p>As the rescuers arrivers, Dr. Geoffrey Sutton, the hotel physician, found the remaining Balis brother alive, but he died the very moment he was placed in a stretcher. By this point, five boys were known to be dead - Watts, 16, Wise, 15,
                    Seddon 13, and the Balis twins, 12. Chapin, 15, and Marble, 12, were still missing.</p>
                <p>Terry Clattenburg had hung on. Sutton gave him a shot of morphine. With Perren supervising, his team gently lowered the 14-year over a cliff and onto a stretcher. Perren and other rescuers bore him down the mountain.</p>
                <p>After a brief pause at the mountain base, Perren's group headed back out and up. It was almost daybreak. One task was to complete digging dig out of Watts' body. </p>
                <p>As Perren chopped at the frozen snow with a shovel, he solved the last mystery. As he finally dislodged Watts' body from the ice, he made a horrific discovery. The two missing boys - Chapin and Marble – were buried beneath Watt. All three
                    bodies were roped together</p>
                <p>Perren pounded the shovel with a hammer to sever the frozen rope. His men hoisted the bodies up onto pack horses and used remnants of the manila rope to cinch them into place. The horses headed down.</p>
                <p>At Banff General Hospital, Ricky Ballard, his forehead wound stitched, visited the bandaged Terry Clattenburg. Ricky was released after four days. Terry, with his skull fractures, was in a for a far longer stay.</p>
                <p>"How bad was it?" Terry asked.</p>
                <p>"There were others hurt much worse than you," Ricky replied.</p>

                <p>For Arthur Wise, the Souderton obstetrician who lost a son, one thing was absolutely clear: William Kershaw should never organize another trip.</p>
                <p>"He was very angry," Willie's brother, Arthur Wise Jr. said recently of his father. " He sent his son off to have a good summer vacation and they killed him through negligence. He didn't think they should take kids anywhere else ever again."</p>
                <p>Not every parent was bitter. In a letter to his son's boarding school, Slocum Chapin wrote that David had died "having the time of his life – actually a really supreme moment – up until the fatal moment." His death was a matter of fate.
                    The family spread David's ashes by plane over the Mount Temple summit. </p>
                <p>Kershaw took a similar view. In New Hampshire with his other travel group at the time of the disaster, he telephoned a statement to the Inquirer: "Such an occurrence can never be fully understood. It is in God's hands, not ours."</p>
                <p>"I plan to continue with the trip I am now leading and will not permit this to spoil a pleasant summer trip for our group," he added.</p>
                <p>The Wise family sued him. So did the Balis family. But Canadian law, especially at that time, was hostile to such lawsuits. The cases were settled for just $7,000 per death.</p>

                <p>As for Dickerson and Oeser, their departure for homes by delayed by a grilling during an official inquest in Banff four days after the deaths. </p>
                <div class="sidebar sidebar-text">
                    <h4>Read the inquest</h4>
                    <p>After the disaster on Mount Temple, Canadian authorities swiftly held an coroner’s inquest.</p>
                    <p>Six jurors heard testimony. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3861915-Avalanche-Inquest-Day-1-7-15-55.html" target="_blank">The first fact-finding session</a> was held in Banff, Alberta, on July 15, 1955, only four days
                        after the seven boys had died. Providing testimony before returning home were three boys who survived the accident, Frederic Ballard, 13, Peter Smith, 12, and Tony Woodfield, 16; and the two counselors, Bill Oeser and Don Dickerson,
                        both 29.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3861914-Avalanche-Inquest-Day-2-8-10-55.html" target="_blank">The next and last day of testimony</a> was held in Banff, on Aug. 10, 1955. The nine witnesses included rescuers and Banff park
                        service wardens.</p>
                    <p>After the testimony, the jurors concluded that the boys died of multiple injuries, shock and exposure. They cleared the park service of any blame, but called said the Philadelphia business that sponsored the trip provided “inadequate”
                        leadership and equipment.</p>
                </div>
                <p>"Could you tell us what your equipment consisted of, sir?" the Crown's questioner asked.</p>
                <p>"An ice axe," Dickerson replied in part.</p>
                <p>"One ice axe?"</p>
                <p>"Yes."</p>
                <p>The inquest officially concluded that the leadership and equipment inadequate for the Mount Temple trip. Prosecutors in Alberta agreed. They blamed the deaths on "poor planning and preparation, poor judgment and inexperience," but ruled
                    out criminal charges.</p>
                <p>Kershaw would continue to operate his summer camp for two more decades. He even sought out business while on probation after his 1977 guilty plea to molesting boys on the previous summer's trip. Though he lost his teaching job at a Quaker
                    school in Philadelphia after his conviction, he lied about his crimes on a Colorado licensing form to resume teaching there.</p>
                <p>He died in 2015 at age 91. In an obituary he prepared in advance, Kershaw made no mention of the avalanche, but wrote that he "loved introducing boys to the wonders of nature."&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Dickerson's smoking continued to bedevil him. After earning a doctorate and a professorship and writing several key works on insurance, he died in 1974 of emphysema. He was only 49.</p>
                <p>Oeser quit teaching to sell insurance. He died in 2015 at age 88. His sister, Sylvia Oeser Warters, said recently that her brother never talked about Mount Temple. "I knew that there was a terrific storm and that somebody died," she said.</p>
                <p>Of the four boys who survived the avalanche, Peter Smith followed perhaps the most unexpected path. After graduation from Williams College in Massachusetts, Smith became a Green Beret and saw heavy combat in Vietnam. He later adopted fierce
                    anti-war views. Later still, he became an Amish farmer. After years of dealing with depression, he killed himself in 2015 at age 71.</p>
                <p>His brother, Mark, said some in the family think the avalanche remained a pivotal event for Peter for his entire life. "It was a tragedy that he had to carry in his life and a burden for him," Mark Smith said.</p>
                <p>As it happened, the other three survivors all went on to graduate from Harvard. Frederick Ballard and Theodore Clattenburg had long careers as lawyers. Tony Woodfield became a U.N. economist. </p>
                <p>Ballard joined the firm that bore his family name. A kindly and respected figure, he died at age 72 in 2014. Clattenburg, who is the only living survivor of the Mount Temple disaster, was an attorney with Community Legal Services, providing
                    legal help for the poor.</p>
                <p>In a recent interview at his Wyndmoor home, he said he still wonders sometimes why he was spared. He shook his head as he recalled how the boys had lobbied Oeser to permit them to keep climbing. </p>
                <p>"He wanted everybody to stop, and like the fools we were, we argued against him and he let us go on up," he said.</p>
                <p> A few years ago, Clattenburg returned with his son to Banff. The father and son climbed to the meadow where Oeser had halted and the boys had continued. </p>
                <p>"I wanted to take a few steps up that path where we began," he said..&nbsp; </p>

                <p>After graduating from Harvard, Woodfield went on to earn a MBA from Cornell University . He was an aide worker in Venezuela, Eastern Europe and Vietnam before embarking on a long career as a UN economist, specializing in part in the gap
                    between rich and poor countries. </p>
                <p> In 2000, he retired in Switzerland, the place of his last posting as a UN official. There, despite the traumatic event years before, he was an avid skier, snow-shoer and mountain climber. He headed the local climbing club.</p>
                <p> Still, nearly 60 years after the tragedy, he was looking for some kind of closure.</p>
                <p>Late in life, Tony learned that someone else had been hunting for information on the internet about the tragedy – a man using a pseudonym, but who said he was married to the sister of victim Billy Watts. </p>
                <div class="testing">This is a test</div>
                <p>Tony set out to find the Watts' family. By tapping into Anestry.com and other genealogical resources, Woodfield determined that Billy had had two sisters – Wendy Watts Field and Laura Watts Pearson. Tony turned up what looked like an email
                    address for Laura. On Sept. 24, 2009, he sent a message to it.</p>
                <p> "Mrs. Pearson," he wrote,. "I was the last person to speak with Billy as I tried to dig him out of the snow before he froze to death."</p>
                <p>If he had indeed reached the right family, Tony wrote, he stood ready to answer any questions that the Watts sisters might have. "I remember it like it happened yesterday, but it also feels many lifetimes ago," he wrote.</p>
                <p>"If you were not related to Billy Watts, i.e. a person who knows nothing about Billy and this accident, please accept my apologies for the identification error.". </p>
                <p>There was no error. He had reached the younger sister of Billy Watts. She was 62, a photographer living in Delaware County. She and her sister embraced Tony's overture.</p>
                <p>In the dialogue that unfolded, Tony provided an unsparing account of the disaster and of Billy's last minutes. Laura, in turn, responded with kindness to Tony's account of his inability to save her brother – and with comfort to Tony's
                    news that he was dying of terminal cancer.</p>
                <p>In his emails, Tony told how he had sidestepped the avalanche and then moved from victim to victim, offering them encouragement and even clothes. He told how he had partially excavated Billy after hearing his voice from below.</p>
                <p>Tony tried to assuage Laura about her brother's suffering.</p>
                <p>"I did not get to know Billy well, but I respected him and liked him for the mature natural-born leader that he was," Tony wrote. "He was feeling very cold and froze to death as I tried to extricate him from the snow, but otherwise did
                    not seem to be any pain that I could tell.</p>
                <p> For her part, Laura spoke of how hard the death had been for her family, especially for her mother and her older sister, who was much closer in age to Billy She then focused on Tony.</p>
                <p>"How difficult it must have been for you to watch while so many died," she wrote "I have often wondered what I would have done if had been there and the frustration of not being able to help. I have recurring dreams of wanting to help
                    people in distress, and it is only now hits me where this come from.</p>
                <p>Laura told Tony he had shared his emails with her older sister, Wendy.</p>
                <p>"What came to both of us as very important in what you revealed to us ... was that Billy didn't die alone – that someone had been with him, trying to help him," Laura said. "And also that you were able to free a good part of him and that
                    he didn't stay under the snow. For some reasons that has disturbed both of us for years – that thought of him trapped under the snow." </p>

                <p>In recent interviews, Laura and Wendy noted that a coroner had determined that Billy has suffered a broken neck. They said this left them wondering whether he might have been swiftly rendered unconscious – mercifully - and that Tony had
                    perhaps confused him with another victim. However, others on the mountain agree it was Watts that Woodfield had encountered. </p>
                <p>In the messages, shared with the Inquirer by the Watts families, Tony and Laura ruminated of the years gone by. Laura noted that she and her husband, Gardiner, and lived in Switzerland, too, during his last years as a U.S. diplomat.</p>
                <p> "You must be about 70 if you were Billy's age. (Are we really this old already?)," Laura wrote.</p>
                <p>Indeed aged 70, Tony let Laura and her sister know that he been diagnosed with terminal colon cancer two years before. He added stoically that CAT scans and probability statistics suggested that he already had lived six months longer than
                    expected.
                </p>
                <p>"You use the word 'terminal.'" Laura replied. "I don't like the sound of that all at all for you. Forgive me, it's not my business, but you feel like a new very good friend and while I really don't know you at all, I feel like I care about
                    your well-being very much." </p>
                <p>As their exchanges wound down, Tony said that a climbing acquaintance had spoken of how valiant he had been on Mount Temple. He said that wasn't so. </p>
                <p> "I had been no hero," he messaged. "Just a teenager who found himself in an impossible situation. I had hoped these past 55 years to put the accident behind me, not to dwell on it, but here we are…."</p>
                <p>Laura and her sister would have none of it.</p>
                <p>"We do thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for being there and helping him," Laura wrote. "You say you weren't a hero, but you were. You simply did what needed be done and you gave it your all."</p>
                <p>Tony Woodfield died four months after forging his connection with the sisters of Billy Watts. </p>

<p><b>A coroner’s summary</b></p>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3866557-Inquest-Summary.html" target="_blank">one-page document,</a> coroner John Thomson presents the conclusion of the six-man jury that looked into the seven deaths on Mount Temple in July 1955.</p>
<p>The jury asked that climbers be reminded that the must register their route with the park before they climb and report back afterwards. The adults supervising the fatal trip did not register the Mount Temple climb in advance.  The jury cleared the park service of any blame, but faulted the leadership and equipment used by Wilderness Travel Camp, which sponsored the deadly climb.</p>

<p><b>Canadian officials decline to bring charges</b></p>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3866556-Alberta-AttorneyGeneral-Review.html" target ="_blank">two-page letter,</a> an official of the attorney general’s office for the Province of Alberta faulted the climb or “poor planning and preparation, poor judgment and inexperience,” but said he did not find criminal wrongdoing.</p>

<p><b>A damning report from the park service</b></p>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3863730-Avalanche-Report.html" target="_blank">report,</a> Bertram Pittaway, assistant chief park warden, criticized the Wilderness Travel Camp’s “very poor leadership,” and its equipment.  Had the group sought approval to climb, it “would not have b een allowed on this slope,” he wrote.  His reported included a dozen pages of photographs.</p>
